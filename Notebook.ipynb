        "# Sentiment Analysis through Unsupervised Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "In this jupyter notebook, I will show you how to apply sentiment analysis to a text through an Unsupervised Learning (UL) technique, based on the AFINN lexicon. This tutorial exploits the `afinn` Python package, which is available only for English and Danish. If your text is written into a different language, you could translate it before in English and use the `afinn` package.\n",

The masterpiece is split in 13 books. We have stored each book into a different file, named number.text (e.g. 1.txt and 2.txt). Each line of every file contains just one sentence.\n",
